# Project to learn about [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation).

### What is Sass? 

<!-- https://sass-lang.com/documentation -->
 > Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s **compiled to CSS**.
    It allows you to use `variables`, `nested rules`, `mixins`, `functions`, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.
    Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

### Install

 - I will install `Sass` with [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), but your can [install](https://sass-lang.com/install) from another place.

    #### Install `Npm`

     - `sudo apt update`
     - `sudo apt upgrade`
     - `sudo apt-get install npm`

     - Or you can see other ways to [install](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
     
    #### Installing `Sass` with Npm

     - `npm install -g sass`
